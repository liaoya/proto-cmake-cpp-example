# README

This example is an enhancement based on <https://gitlab.com/darth_ocir/cppprotobufbasic/-/tree/refactor-into-lib>.
This example must work for both protobuf before and after `21.12`

`install-protobuf.sh` is used to install protoc and libprotobuf, run `./install-protobuf.sh -h` for how to use it.
